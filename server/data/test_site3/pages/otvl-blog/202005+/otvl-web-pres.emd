Otvl_web is an Open Source web application mainly intended to publish content efficiently.

There is (yet) no GUI for publishing, so the content publisher has to update the site
using technical tools to modifiy and upload files.
However, the files structure and their contents remain easy to understand.

The benefits of this tool are

- from a content publisher point of view:
    - the site structure and how it is navigable by the end-user through menus/sub-menus
      is configurable;
    - the web application also features a simple blog publish application;
    - the pages content is described by a sequence of textual, graphical or video items, as well
      as hyperlinks and some page layout directive;
    - the site configuration, the pages content,
      media files such as documents, images and video files
      are managed directly as files on the server;
    - the pages contents are described in
      [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
- from a developper point of view:
    - the front-end is developped with
      [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
      and more specifically
      [quasar](https://quasar.dev/)
      layouts and components,
      so the site general _look-and-feel_ may be customized and enriched efficiently;
    - on the server side, a collection of simple REST web services are developped in python,
      their roles being mainly to serve files to the Vue.js client, either directly or
      with trivial yaml-to-json conversion;
    - this simple design also enables to add specific site features through rapid development.
