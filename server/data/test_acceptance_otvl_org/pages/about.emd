. Feedback is appreciated through these networks.

The articles are written in English in the hope they will be helpful to more people,
but as my native language is French, please forgive any errors and ungraceful content.

### What

You will find here articles in the domains of software development, data science,
software engineering, system architecture, system deployment,
and related methods and practices.

The articles contents are rather technical, yet by no means reserved to specialists.
The goal is to share information and know-how acquired through readings, work, practice,
but in first place thanks to the work and help of so many other people.

### With what

This site runs thanks to: the Internet, Linux, Debian, Apache, Python, ES6, Vue.js, Quasar framework
and a multitude of Open Source tools and libraries.
