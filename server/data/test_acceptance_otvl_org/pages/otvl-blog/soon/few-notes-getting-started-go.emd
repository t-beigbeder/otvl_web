** Preview: ** this is a work in progress.

## Introduction

A lot of reasons can lead you to start programming with [Go](https://golang.org/):

- You can build [system software](https://github.com/containous/traefik/)
- You can build [safer software](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs)
- Learning a new language is as exciting as visiting a [new foreign country](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
- You can understand Kubernetes [code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- You can build Kubernetes [operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)
- You can build [super minimal](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/) Docker images
- It is [open source](https://github.com/golang/go)
- The community is [great](https://golang.org/CONTRIBUTORS)
- It is developed in [Go](https://github.com/golang/go)
- You loved [C](https://opensource.com/article/19/10/command-line-heroes-c) once,
  and it is [like C](https://blog.golang.org/cgo)
- It has great [concurrency patterns](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency)

Hum... you can also [temperate](https://bluxte.net/musings/2018/04/10/go-good-bad-ugly/) all this.

### Books

- [The Go Programming Language](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-go-programming/9780134190570/): like _The C Programming Language_ from K&R but for Go
