# Mixing local and cloud data access for Data Science

![logo work in progess](/assets/images/common/wip.png "Logo work in progress")

** Preview: ** this is a work in progress.

## Introduction

Relying on Cloud Computing services is often an opportunity for Data Science projects,
however, as both local and cloud processing must often coexist,
the data access must be designed carefully.

After browsing available solutions for the support of various use cases,
this article discusses their implementations.

You will find useful references at the bottom of this page.

## Use cases

It may be useful to consider first
that there is a wide range of requirements as far as a Big Data Platform is concerned.
You may browse the presentation from AWS 
_"[Next-Gen Data Lakes and Analytics Platforms](https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/nextgen-data-lakes-and-analytics-platforms-aws-summit-sydney)"_
to make tour opinion.
To keep things simple, we will restrict the discussion here
to low-end and medium-range requirements considering what could be called
the _data access bandwidth_, i.e. the need to access a large dataset in a small time frame.
